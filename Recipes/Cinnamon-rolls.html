<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This cinnamon roll recipe doesn’t require a ton of ingredients, but it does require love,
    patience and dedication to the true recipe — meaning don’t deter from the original!
    These are called the best cinnamon rolls for a reason, and that requires following
    the recipe as instructed. Here’s what you’ll need to make the best cinnamon rolls:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Milk: I recommend 2% or whole milk, but know that almond milk will also work (I’ve tried it!) See my tips below
        for ensuring your milk is at the right temperature.</li>
    <li>Granulated sugar: this is used to sweeten the cinnamon rolls and to help activate the yeast.</li>
    <li>Quick rise yeast: use quick rise or instant yeast in this recipe to help the cinnamon rolls rise faster. You can
        also use active dry yeast, but the cinnamon rolls may take slightly longer to rise. Scroll down to get tips for
        using yeast in this recipe!</li>
    <li>Butter: the one and only. I prefer to use salted butter but unsalted is great too. You’ll need it for the dough,
        filling and icing.</li>
    <li>Egg + egg yolk: this recipe calls for 1 egg and 1 egg yolk for the perfect texture and rich consistency in the
        dough.</li>
    <li>Bread flour: to help keep these cinnamon rolls soft and fluffy, we’re using bread flour, which has a higher
        protein level to help lighten the cinnamon roll texture. The higher amounts of protein help to produce more
        gluten, which gives cinnamon roll the chewy, soft texture you know and love.</li>
    <li>Brown sugar: personally, I love using dark brown sugar for more robust molasses sweet flavor in those cinnamon
        swirls, but light brown sugar will work!
        Cinnamon: YUM.</li>
    <li>Salt: cinnamon rolls made without salt tastes very plain and in addition, salt also helps to control yeast in
        cinnamon roll recipes so don’t skip it.
        For the icing: the icing is truly unforgettable too! Just cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for making the best cinnamon rolls</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Don’t overheat your milk. It should be between 105-115 degrees F. Anything hotter is likely to kill the yeast,
        which means the cinnamon rolls will not rise. A simple tip is to dip your finger in the milk — it should feel
        warm similar to warm bath water but not HOT. If you warmed it up too much, simply wait a few minutes until it
        cools down enough to touch.</li>
    <li>Make sure to use room temperature butter for the filling: a lot of recipes call for using melted butter in the
        filling, but that will cause the filling to leak out before baking. Room temperature butter is best!</li>
    <li>Rub the brown sugar into the butter: after you spread out the softened butter, it’s important to rub the brown
        sugar into the butter and dough so that it’s well combined. Please refer to the video!</li>
    <li>Use a room temperature egg in the dough: if you use a cold egg, there’s a chance it could affect the yeast or
        mix with the melted butter and cause it to coagulate. To bring your eggs to room temperature simply place them
        in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes.</li>
