<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One reader, Sharon, says: “I have made plenty of banana breads over the years, but by far this one is my favorite!!
    Easy to make, perfectly moist without being too ‘cakey’, and full of flavor! Definitely a keeper!”

    Banana bread slices
    This is my favorite banana bread recipe, one that I’ve cherished for years. It’s the recipe that comes to mind first
    when I have leftover spotty bananas on the counter and the bread that’s on constant rotation in my freezer stash.
    This is the best ever banana bread recipe and if you haven’t tried it yet, now’s the time.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Butter: Use softened butter for a soft texture and irresistible butter flavor.</li>
    <li>Brown Sugar: Use all brown sugar in this recipe. In the headnotes for this chocolate chip cookies recipe, I
        explain that brown sugar yields soft and moist cookies. Well brown sugar works that same magic in banana bread,
        too. It also adds wonderful flavor.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Eggs supply cakes, cupcakes, breads, doughs, and cookies their stability and structure, as well as a
        tender texture. You’ll need 2 large eggs in this banana bread recipe.</li>
    <li>Yogurt: Yogurt adds even more moisture to this banana bread. I like to use yogurt as much as possible when I’m
        baking. Sour cream is a wonderful substitution for plain yogurt. You can use the two interchangeably in most
        baking recipes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9×5-inch loaf
        pan or coat with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar
        together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
        beating well after each addition. Beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract on medium speed until
        combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no
        flour pockets remain. Do not overmix. Fold in the nuts, if using.</li>
    <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 60-65 minutes. Loosely cover the bread with aluminum
        foil after 30 minutes to help prevent the top and sides from getting too brown. A toothpick inserted in the
        center of the loaf will come out clean when the bread is done. Remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool
        completely in the pan set on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana
        bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together. See post above for freezing instructions.
